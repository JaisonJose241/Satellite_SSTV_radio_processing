# Satellite_SSTV_radio_processing
this is a repo for audio processing the SSTV signals in order to achieve maximum quality of image from ISS; after the hardware limitations.
Currently experimenting with "librosa" and Fast Fourier Transform method to amplify and denoise the signal.
Afterwards I am planning to do Image Processing in the generated image.
